## Characteristics

### Personality Traits
- loves a good drink
- loves a good scrap (for fun, with the homies)
- bit of a gruff / stoic demeanor, but actually pretty generous and considerate with his friends

### Ideal
- **Generosity**. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good)

### Bond
- loves his sister Hilda, but they frequently bicker
- may have met uncle Gundren at 1-2 social family gatherings??
- R&R A&A is his and Hilda's baby
- absolutely hates criminals and evildoers (almost 0 nuance)

### Flaw
- sometimes a *little* racist in that way where you can tell he had a traditional Dwarven upbringing, but isn't actually trying to be mean or racially supremacist (basically the racism that comes from a place of ignorance, rather than the KKK shit)
- somewhat judgy of others' cultures
- almost always speaks his mind, except when in "business savvy" mode
