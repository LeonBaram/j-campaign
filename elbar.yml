  ## guild artisan features
  guild_membership:
    link: https://2014.5e.tools/backgrounds.html#guild%20artisan_phb
    summary: |
      As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.
      Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
      You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

personality_traits: |
  - loves a good drink
  - loves a good scrap (for fun, with the homies)
  - bit of a gruff / stoic demeanor, but actually pretty generous and considerate with his friends

ideals: |
  - Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good)

bonds: |
  - loves his sister Hilda, but they frequently bicker
  - may have met uncle Gundren at 1-2 social family gatherings??
  - R&R A&A is his and Hilda's baby
  - absolutely hates criminals and evildoers (almost 0 nuance)

flaws: |
  - sometimes a *little* racist in that way where you can tell he had a traditional Dwarven upbringing, but isn't actually trying to be mean or racially supremacist (basically the racism that comes from a place of ignorance, rather than the KKK shit)
  - somewhat judgy of others' cultures
  - almost always speaks his mind, except when in "business savvy" mode

notes: |
  - monthly guild payment is 10gp instead of default due to adamantine shipment
