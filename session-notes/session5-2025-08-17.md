# Session 5 Notes

We find a letter in glass staff's chambers (the leader of the red brands):

> Lord Albrek,
> My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the dwarves.
> Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don't allow them to upset our plans. See that any dwarven maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste.
> I'm counting on you, Iarno. Don't disappoint me.

in his chambers we also find a chest with:

- 180sp
- 130gp
- silk pouch with 5 gems each worth 10gp, 2 gems each worth 15gp, 1 pearl worth 100gp
