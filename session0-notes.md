## Notes about Main Campaign

### Adventure Start
Characters start at level 1. Race and class must be chosen from the Player's Handbook.  
When the adventure begins, the characters are part of a caravan.  
The caravan is on the road, heading from the city of Neverwinter to the city of Phandalin.  
The caravan is owned by the dwarf **Gundren Rockseeker**, who is transporting goods from Neverwinter to Phandalin.  
Gundren Rockseeker has travelled to Phandalin on his own, ahead of the caravan.  
(Note: Gundren Rockseeker is a relatively pivotal NPC)

**potential character hooks:**
- your character was hired by the caravan for security
    - note: anyone hired by the caravan for security will be paid 10gp on arrival to Phandalin
- your character is acquainted with Gundren Rockseeker
- your character has ended up on the caravan in some other way

## Notes about One-Shot
Characters start at level 5. Race and class must be chosen from the Player's Handbook.  
The party starts in the small city of Triboar, where they accept an assignment from a bounty board.  
The assignment is from Triboar's  Lord, seeking a band of adventurers to deal with a group of goblin highwaymen/bandits.  
The reward for completing the assignment is 5000gp (subject to DM revision).  
(Note: as part of their backstory, the adventurers should already know one another.)  
(Note: the "one-shot" may last for 2-3 sessions.)  
(Note: the characters from this one-shot may be reused for further one-shots / adventures.)  

## Do's and Don'ts

### Game Tone
- roleplay participation & engagement is highly encouraged
    - when your character does in-game actions, you're encouraged to describe *how* they do things, not just *what* they do.
    - including additional details helps with roleplay and enhances immersion

- silly things that take people out of the game / reduce immersion are discouraged
    - note: occasional silliness is good. overpowering silliness all the time is bad if/when it detracts from the rest of the game.

- don't make an Evil-aligned character, unless you discuss with Jake first.

- ensure your character's motivations are aligned with the overall direction of the adventure.
    - e.g. if going on the adventure "is not something your character would do", then your character is probably a bad fit.

- avoid endangering the adventure's integrity. Be mindful of the consequences of your actions in-game.
    - e.g. if you murder the king, the adventure may no longer be possible.

### Behavior
- please respect other people's hard boundaries / red lines (e.g. no depictions of sexual harassment / assault)
- NO PVP, unless there is explicit discussion & understanding between the players and Jake beforehand
- don't boss around other people
    - don't give unwanted/unasked-for advice
    - don't powergame to the detriment of others' enjoyment of the game
- please come to the table sober (except for maybe a mild buzz)
- if Jake makes a final decision or ruling, don't argue with him
    - you are allowed to offer suggestions/appeals if you notice Jake makes a mistake. but final means final

### Show up to every session, on time
- **please** make every effort to attend every session, on time.
    - flakiness only makes it worse for the rest of the group.
- if you are unable to attend, or will be late, **please** inform Jake (and/or the group) as soon as possible.
- if you are unable to attend, Jake can pilot your character for that session.

#### Player Absence Policy
- if only 1 player is missing, Jake will DMPC their character
- if more than 1 player is missing, the session is cancelled
- if this happens repeatedly, there may be XP penalties, or people may be kicked out of the campaign

### Come prepared
- know your character and their abilities
- know the basic rules of the game
    - everything under "Part 2" at this link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014
    - alternatively Chapter 7 and 9 of the Player's Handbook contain most of this info
- show up to session 1 with a ***complete*** character sheet
- when your character casts a spell or uses a feature, read its description out to the table to remind the rest of us what it does.
    - if it's something your character uses often, you can skip this.

### Stay Engaged
- pay attention during combat
- pay attention during roleplay
- taking notes may help
- webcams definitely help
- if you struggle with this (e.g. waiting for your turn in combat), do whatever you need to do stay focused
- if it is your turn in combat, you have a roughly 30-40sec timer to decide what to do
    - if you are too indecisive, your turn is skipped (you take the dodge action)
    - please try to think about your upcoming turn while other people do their thing


### No Cheating
- do not fudge dice rolls. the dice are there to tell a story. you rolled what you rolled.
- do not metagame. if your character doesn't know something, roleplaying that adds to the fun.
- do not look up monster statblocks, or information about the adventuring module.
    - you are meant to discover that information organically, in-game.
    - this is basically spoilers for you and others.

### Talk to Jake
- if at any point, there is some content you are not comfortable with in the campaign, please talk to Jake
- if you have an issue with any aspect of the campaign (adventure contents, other people's behavior, Jake's DMing style), please talk to Jake
- if you want to retire your current character, talk to Jake
    - please don't cycle through characters too much

## Other Notes

### Character Death
If your character permanently dies, and you need to make a new character, the new character is not guaranteed to show up right away in the adventure. They will be integrated at the earliest *fitting* opportunity, but you may need to wait a little bit.

### Resource Tracking
This campaign will be relatively detail-oriented when it comes to tracking resources, including ammo, rations, time/money spent, travel rules, forage rules, etc.
