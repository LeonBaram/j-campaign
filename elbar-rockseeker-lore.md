## background
- guild artisan
- together with his sister Hilda, owns a smithy + weapons shop in Neverwinter called "R&R Arms & Armor"
- they are from the Rockseeker clan, but moved to Neverwinter to set up shop for better business prospects

## why he's on the caravan
- Elbar and Hilda are part of the same clan as Gundren Rockseeker
- R&R A&A has a potential trade partner in Phandalin (Halia) who is apparently willing to source some adamantine. Elbar is traveling to Phaldalin to meet them personally, establish a proper business relationship, inspect their wares, seal the deal, and personally accompany the shipment (because the metals are CRAZY valuable)

## why he's a paladin
- extremely strong sense of justice and right & wrong
- has repeatedly inserted himself in the middle of dangerous situations on the Neverwinter streets to stop crimes / rescue victims
- when he was a child, he watched his father get robbed and had a festering resentment for criminals and evildoers ever since (his dad is still alive though, so no Batman origin story)

## personality
- loves a good drink
- loves a good scrap (for fun, with the homies)
- bit of a gruff / stoic demeanor, but actually pretty generous and considerate with his friends

## bonds
- loves his sister Hilda, but they frequently bicker
- may have met uncle Gundren at 1-2 social family gatherings??
- R&R A&A is his and Hilda's baby
- absolutely hates criminals and evildoers (almost 0 nuance)

## flaws
- sometimes a *little* racist in that way where you can tell he had a traditional Dwarven upbringing, but isn't actually trying to be mean or racially supremacist (basically the racism that comes from a place of ignorance, rather than the KKK shit)
- somewhat judgy of others' cultures
- almost always speaks his mind, except when in "business savvy" mode
